 ## Introduction
 
 
 My name is Imran Mohiuddin and I am a third year resident in the Internal Medicine department at Jackson Memorial Hospital/University of Miami in Miami Florida.  I am a life long technology enthusiast who first started learning about the field of data science and learning to code in R/python as a hobby in early 2017.  With time, my interest in the field has continued to grow, especially as it relates to the practice of medicine. Next year I will be a chief resident in quality improvement where I will  leverage my domain knowledge of medicine with my skills in data science to perform analyses and deliver digital products for clinicians that improve clinical outcomes and reduce wasteful spending. Afterwards, I plan on pursuing a fellowship in cardiology. 

 
Ultimately, I hope to practice cardiology in an academic medical center and work on developing machine learning methods for anomaly detection in biometric data from 5G connected devices to predict which patients are at high risk for sudden cardiac death or myocardial infarction.  I am also interested in researching/developing best practices for the use of biometric data in clinical medicine. 
 
 
 
I am setting up this github to catalogue the work that I am doing, both for myself and for others, to highlight my development as a data scientist accross time. My ultimate goal is to become an expert in a field that is only now starting to take shape.
