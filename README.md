 **Introduction**
 My name is Imran Mohiuddin and I am a third year resident in the Internal Medicine department at Jackson Memorial Hospital/University of Miami in Miami Florida.  I am a life long technology enthusiast who first started learning about the field of data science and learning to code in R/python as a hobby in early 2017.  With time, my interest in the field has continued to grow, especially as it relates to the practice of medicine. Next year I will be a chief resident in quality improvement where I will  leverage my domain knowledge of medicine with my skills in data science to perform analyses and deliver digital products for clinicians that improve clinical outcomes and reduce wasteful spending. Afterwards, I plan on pursuing a fellowship in cardiology. 
 
 Long-term, I hope to practice cardiology in an academic medical center and work on developing machine learning methods for anomaly detection in biometric data from 5G connected devices.
